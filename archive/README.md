# Azure Lighthouse demo sample

## Setup

These are configured for the objectIDs and tenantIDs in microsoft.com, so are unsuitable as they stand for partner demos. Download the files, fork the repo etc. so you can customise your descriptions, objectIDs, tenantID etc.

## Template

The azurecitadel.json ARM template is hardcoded so that a Lighthouse definition can be provisioned with a single CLI call.

This makes it simple for a "customer" to create the definition using the Cloud Shell, ready for the customer to assign in the Service Providers portal blade.

## Alternative sources of information

Refer to:

* [Marketplace documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/how-to/publish-managed-services-offers) for information on creating published managed services
* [Azure Lighthouse samples](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Lighthouse-samples) for examples that show both definition and assignment (i.e. for deployment under CSP AOBO scenarios)

> ARM parameterisation in a Lighthouse context is arguable more useful when defining the scope points and definitions for assignments, rather than just making the definitions more flexible.

## Authorizations

There are three assignments in the sample files:

1. User Principal as Contributor
1. Security Group as Reader
1. Service Principal as Billing Reader

They are there to illustrate the authorisations as a list and throw in a few variants for different built in roles and security principals.

If you don't already have a service principal then you can create one in the service provider context by logging in and then running `az ad sp create-for-rbac --name http://billingreader --skip-assignment`. (The last switch skips the standard Contributor at subscription scope RBAC assignment.)

## Demo Recommendations

From experience I would recommend isolating the service provider and customer views, and making them visually different:

* isolate bookmarks, stored credentials, plus cookies and tokens using multiple browsers or browser profiles
* use Windows 10's or MacOS' virtual desktops and touchpad gestures, so you can visually slide between the service provider and customer views
* use different themes in the Azure Portal

Go slow and make sure your audience knows where they are as it can be confusing if you start skipping around too much.

## Demo Script

### Service Provider #1

As the Service Provider, you can log in under your context, show the Directory + Subscription filter.

Show the objectIDs in Users and in Groups.

For the service principal, go to App Registrations and then descend down to the service principal using the _Managed application in local directory_ link in the top section of the Overview. It is the Object ID for the service principal that you need, not the Application ID.  (The App ID links the service principal up into the App Object.)

Alternatively, run the `guids.sh` script to show the commands to pull out the relevant GUIDs using Azure CLI and JMESPATH queries.

### Customer #1

Log in as the customer. (I would use a separate profile in Microsoft Edge to keep things sane, and then use <https://shell.azure.com> and the portal.)

Add the definition. Either copy all of the files into the Cloud Shell (which supports drag and drop) and run the lighthouse.sh command.

Or just run this one to call on the azurecitadel.json with no parameter file:

```bash
az deployment create --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richeney/lighthouse/master/azurecitadel.json --location westeurope
```

> Note that this wil be updated once we can add `--scope-type tenant` to deploy this to the Root Tenant Group.

Once deployed then show the Service Providers screen. View the definition, and assign to a subscription, resource group or multiple resource groups.

> You can do this in one hit in the template as per the [samples](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Lighthouse-samples), but I like the customer experience in the portal.

### Service Provider #2

A good time to go through some decks until it settles down.

Show the My Customers blade and the delegations.

Open the Directory + Subscriptions filter and show the projections. Then view resource groups, all resources, virtual machines, or whatever resource view you want based on the delegated resources.

Show the IAM for an RG.  Only the authorisations will be visible - the service provider cannot see the customer's IAM. Mention that only build in roles can be used, and not if they have data actions.

Make a change, e.g. shutting down a test VM.

Discuss [PAL](https://aka.ms/partneradminlink) assignments for partner recognition for influenced ACR.

### Customer #2

View the Activity Log and see the transparency in the audit trail.

View the delegations.  Show how you can add another. Look at the Service Provider offers, and delete the whole delegation for the demo. Customer retains the ability to revoke access.

### Service Provider #3

Refresh the last view and the delegated resources should now have disappeared. Also gone from the filter.

Discuss roadmap such as Privileged Identity integration (e..g just in time, just enough access)

## Tips

If you ever change your URIs on the fly, then force curl to skip the cache using:

```bash
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richeney/lighthouse/master/azurecitadel.json
```

You can use this to redirect to a file in Cloud Shell.

The `pal.sh` script is included for reference. You will need to customise to use the correct MPN ID rather than the demo one I've borrowed.
